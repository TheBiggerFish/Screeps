# Screeps

The purpose of this repository is to track the Javascript code and objects used in my playing of the game [Screeps](https://store.steampowered.com/app/464350/Screeps/)

```

## APIs Referenced

- [Screeps API](https://docs.screeps.com/api/)

## Roadmap

- (Current) Prioritize spawning based on current need instead of the list of roles
- Build roads and storage automatically
- Set up transporters for extensions and other energy-using structures
- Automatically determine loadout of a given creep based on number of extensions in a room
- (Potentially) Map entire room to store locations of swamp and structures
- Create roles with expansion and defense in mind
